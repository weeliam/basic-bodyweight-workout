							<p>Nutrition is an essential part of fitness because it provides the body with the necessary energy, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients needed to fuel physical activity. Eating a balanced diet helps to ensure that the body has the energy it needs to perform optimally, while also providing the essential building blocks for muscle growth, repair, and recovery. Additionally, eating a healthy diet can help to prevent nutrient deficiencies which can lead to fatigue, poor performance, and other health issues.</p>

								<h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/carbs.png" alt="" /></a>

							<p>Carbohydrates are one of the three macronutrients that are essential for proper nutrition and fitness. They are the body’s main source of energy and are found in a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products. Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose, which is the main source of fuel for the cells. In addition, they are important for the proper functioning of the nervous system and for the synthesis of certain hormones.</p>
					        <p>Carbohydrates are classified into three categories: simple, complex, and fiber. Simple carbohydrates include sugars found in processed foods, such as candy, soda, and baked goods. Complex carbohydrates are found in whole grains, legumes, and starchy vegetables. Fiber, which is not digested, is found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</p>
					        <p>In order to maintain optimal health and fitness, it is important to consume the right type and amount of carbohydrates. Eating too many simple carbohydrates can lead to weight gain, while eating too few complex carbohydrates can lead to fatigue and other health problems. Eating a balanced diet that includes a variety of sources of carbohydrates is essential for good health and fitness.</p>


					         <h2>Examples of carbohydrates for a Nutrition Plan for Training:</h2>
        <h3>Oats:</h3>
        <p>Oats are a great source of complex carbohydrates, which provide sustained energy for your body. They are also high in dietary fiber, which helps to keep you feeling full for longer.</p>
        <h3>Sweet Potatoes:</h3>
        <p> Sweet potatoes are a great source of complex carbohydrates that are also high in fiber and vitamins.</p>
        <h3>Brown Rice:</h3>

								<h2>Protein</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/protein.png" alt="" /></a>

							 <p>Proteins are essential macronutrients that are found in all living cells and are essential for a wide variety of physiological functions. In nutrition and fitness, proteins are important for the growth, maintenance, and repair of the body’s tissues, as well as for energy production. Proteins are made up of amino acids, which are the building blocks of life. There are nine essential amino acids that must be obtained from dietary sources, as the body cannot make them on its own.</p>
        <p class="lead">Proteins are found in a variety of foods, including meat, dairy, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Animal sources of protein are considered complete proteins, as they contain all nine essential amino acids. Plant sources of protein, such as legumes, nuts, and seeds, are considered incomplete proteins, as they do not contain all nine essential amino acids.</p>
        <p class="lead">In nutrition and fitness, proteins are important for maintaining a healthy body weight, building muscle, and promoting recovery after exercise. Protein also helps to slow digestion, which can help to keep you feeling fuller for longer. Eating a balanced diet that includes a variety of protein sources is essential for optimal health and fitness.</p>

	<p>Drinking water is essential for proper nutrition during exercise. It is important to stay hydrated before, during, and after physical activity to maintain optimal performance and prevent dehydration.</p>

	<p>When you exercise, your body loses water through sweating and breathing. This loss of water can lead to dehydration, which can cause fatigue, muscle cramps, and dizziness. To prevent dehydration, it is recommended that you drink water before, during, and after exercise.</p>

	<p>Before exercise, it is recommended that you drink 17-20 ounces of water 2-3 hours before your workout. This will help ensure that your body is properly hydrated before you start exercising.</p>

	<p>During exercise, it is recommended that you drink water every 10-20 minutes to replenish the fluids lost through sweating. The amount of water you need to drink will depend on the intensity and duration of your workout, as well as your body weight and sweat rate.</p>

	<p>After exercise, it is important to continue drinking water to replace the fluids lost during your workout. It is recommended that you drink at least 8 ounces of water within 30 minutes of finishing your workout, and then continue to drink water throughout the day to stay hydrated.</p>

	<p>In addition to staying hydrated, drinking water can also help with weight loss and digestion. It can help you feel full, which can reduce your appetite and prevent overeating. It can also help with digestion by flushing out toxins and waste from your body.</p>

	<p>Overall, drinking water is essential for proper nutrition during exercise. It helps maintain optimal performance, prevents dehydration, and can also aid in weight loss and digestion.</p>
